## Metarhia tech stack documentation

Metarhia is the **first** technology stack for Node.js scaled with **threads**, offering ultra-lightweight workload **isolation**.
It is optimized for **high-intensive** data exchange, rapid development, **clean architecture**, and easily understandable domain-specific code.
Metarhia provides an all-in-one solution for a **reliable** and **efficient backend**. It supports network communication with web and mobile clients, offers a protocol-agnostic **API**, run-time type validation, real-time and in-memory data processing, and both **stateful** and **stateless** services.

**Weaknesses**: not suitable as content publishing platforms, including blogs and SEO-focused websites, as well as server-side rendering and serving static content.

**Strengths**: enhanced security and architecture suitable for enterprise-level applications, long-lived WebSocket connections to minimize latency and handshake overhead, and no third-party dependencies.
